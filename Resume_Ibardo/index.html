        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>
            I’m a 2nd-year IT student with a passion for technology and programming. Currently, I’m focusing on expanding my skills in C# and web development. I’ve worked on several personal projects, including a Barangay Management System to digitalize resident data. I also enjoy designing UI interfaces using Figma and have experience with HTML and CSS. While I don’t have formal work experience yet, I am committed to learning and applying new technologies. I believe in writing clean, efficient code and enjoy solving complex programming challenges. My goal is to become a proficient full-stack developer and contribute to meaningful projects. I’m always eager to learn and grow in the tech field.
